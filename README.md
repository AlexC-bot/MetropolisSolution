# MetropolisSolution

To build the "mysolution" executable cd into the 
/build directory and run the "make" command.

Once the "mysolution" executable has compiled, it should be within the  
/build directory. 

Type "./mysolution" into your terminal to
get the hexadecimal converted character data from channel 7.

The source code to my solution, "solution.cpp", is located in the /src directory.

## Hexadecimal Converted Output From Channel 7 ##

output: 37 34 5 0 

I was only receiving 4 chracters form Channel 7.
